              I love teaching. I have been teaching math and physics for
              highschool students since 3 years ago. Teaching is a part of my
              life and gives me more energy to do other things. I also tried
              teaching assistant for Advanced programming course twice and it
              was lovely.

              I'm experienced in web development (both back-end and front-end).
              I do many project using javascript frameworks and libraries like
              Vue.js, React.js, Node.js and Nest.js. I'm also familiar with
              clean code, object-oriented programming, functional programming
              and design patterns. I've been working with Unix-based operating
              systems like Linux since 2020.

              Time flies when I do programming. There are few other activities
              that have the same feeling. I sometimes do programming just for
              fun. There are some programming languages like C, C++, Java,
              Python and swift, i have programmed in them but I always prefer
              JavaScript.
